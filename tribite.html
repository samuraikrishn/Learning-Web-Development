        </h2>
        <p>Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam came from humble beginnings, faced many failures, but rose to become the "Missile Man of India" and the People’s President.</p>
        <blockquote>
            "Dream is not that which you see while sleeping, it is something that does not let you sleep."
        </blockquote>
        <p>His journey reminds me that persistence, humility, and vision are the true building blocks of greatness.</p>

        <h2>Mark Zuckerberg – The Builder of Connections 
            <img src="mark_zuckerberg.jpg" alt="Mark Zuckerberg" width="100" height="100" style="float:right;">
        </h2>
        <p>Mark Zuckerberg inspires me because:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Started Young:</strong> At 19, he built Facebook from his dorm room without waiting for funding or approval.</li>
            <li><strong>Focused Vision:</strong> His mission was not just a website but to connect the world.</li>
            <li><strong>Relentless Execution:</strong> He kept building even when people didn’t believe in his idea.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This inspires me to start small but start now — whether it’s with my projects or bigger missions like <strong>Nestora</strong>.</p>
